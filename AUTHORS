HISTORY

  ccast started as a collaboration between UMBC and UW in fall 2011,
  with major components from the 2007-2008 FM1 bench and TVAC tests,
  and from Dan Mooney.  This forked early in 2012 into UMBC and UW
  versions that are now entirely separate projects.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

  Thanks to Yong Han for the ILS discussions, NEdN comparisons,
  organizing the extensive group algorithm comparison and testing,
  and for managing a successful project; and to Joe Predina for
  detailed discussions of spectral resampling, a very methodical
  tabulation of the calibration equations, and spreadsheets for
  calculating CrIS interferometric parameters.
