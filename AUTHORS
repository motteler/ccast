HISTORY

  ccast started as a collaboration between UMBC and UW in fall 2010,
  with major components from the 2007-2008 FM1 bench and TVAC tests.
  H. Motteler wrote the L1a processing, starting with Dan Mooney's RDR
  reader, and L. Strow, Dave Tobin, and H.~Motteler all collaborated
  on the L1b.  This forked into a UW version with Fred Nagel's geo
  that got first light, and a UMBC version with NOAA geo that got the
  first high res obs a month later.  In the summer of 2012 H.~Motteler
  updated the UW code to run in the UMBC environment, and for some
  time maintained both versions while continuing to develop the UMBC
  branch.  Major portions of the UW branch, including ICT modeling and
  the non-linearity correction, were updated and merged into the UMBC
  branch.

  The UW branch was closer in some ways to the ATBD and the original
  design.  The UMBC branch works for both regular and high resolution
  modes, interpolates the ILS matrix as a function of the metrology
  laser wavelength, uses slightly different forms of the calibration
  equation, different bandpass filters, and uses a Matlab version of
  Joe Predina's spreadsheet to calculate interferometric parameters.
  The UMBC branch uses UW code for the ICT modeling, non-linearity
  correction, and the metrology laser wavelength calculation.
