HISTORY

  ccast started as a collaboration of UMBC and UW in the fall of
  2010.  I wrote the L1a and some of the initial L1b support code
  using Dan's RDR reader, and Larrabee, Dave, and I all worked on
  calibration.  That forked into a UW version that got first light
  and a UMBC version that got the first high res obs a month later.
  By summer of 2011 I merged these to run in the same environment,
  and since then have maintained the UW branch while continuing to
  develop the UMBC branch and support code.

  The UW branch is closer in many ways to the ATBD and the original
  design.  The UMBC branch works for both regular and high resolution
  modes, interpolates the ILS matrix as a function of the metrology
  laser wavelength, uses a slightly different forms of the calibration
  equation, different bandpass filters, a double FFT to interpolate to
  the user grid, and a matlab version of Joe Predina's spreadsheet to
  calculate interferometric parameters.  The UMBC branch uses UW code
  for the ICT modeling, non-linearity correction, and the metrology
  laser calculation.
