HISTORY

  ccast started as a collaboration of UMBC and UW in the fall of
  2010, though some of the code goes back to the 2007-2008 FM1 bench
  and TVAC tests.  I wrote the L1a and initial L1b support, based on
  Dan Mooney's RDR reader, and Larrabee, Dave, and I all worked on
  calibration.  That forked into a UW version that got first light
  and a UMBC version that got the first high res obs a month later.
  By summer of 2011 I merged these to run in the same environment,
  and since then have maintained a version of the UW branch while
  continuing to develop the UMBC branch and support code.

  The UW branch is closer in some ways to the ATBD and the original
  design.  The UMBC branch works for both regular and high resolution
  modes, interpolates the ILS matrix as a function of the metrology
  laser wavelength, uses slightly different forms of the calibration
  equation, different bandpass filters, and uses a matlab version of
  Joe Predina's spreadsheet to calculate interferometric parameters.
  The UMBC branch uses UW code for the ICT modeling, non-linearity
  correction, and the metrology laser wavelength calculation.
