Some of the main procedures 
-----------------------------

rdr2mat     - process RDR h5 files to mat files

rdr2sdr     - process RDR mat files to SDR mat files
scipack     - process sci and eng packets
checkRDRf   - validate the RDR data
scanorder   - group data into scans
calmain2    - main calibration procedure, Dave T. version
calmain3    - main calibration procedure, new hi res branch
calmain4    - main calibration procedure, general purpose 

igm2spec    - take interferograms to uncalibrated spectra
inst_params - set selected instrument parameters
movavg_pre  - preprocess moving averages
movavg_app  - calculate or load moving averages

oaffov2     - spectral space SRF, Scott & Dave
mkSRFwl     - build SRF matrix tables for interpolation
getSRFwl    - wlaser SRF matrix interpolation
finterp     - fourier interpolation for FTIR data
bandpass    - spectral domain bandpass filter

sdr2rtp     - process SDR mat files to RTP files

davet/ - Dave's procedures, mostly from dcast, added after they are
         checked out as being compatible with the bcast code

davet2/ - Earlier versions of Dave's code, before the 20 Dec fork.


To Do List
-----------

+ uh oh, calmain4 gives major cal errors after ES nlc sweep parity
  fix and mods to loop on sweep dire sweep dir.  calmain4.bak was OK

- how to manage calibration and other major branches?
    - code subtrees, select with addpath
    - opts flags and case statements
    - git branches

  none of these is ideal.  git makes working with both branches at
  the same time a hassle, opts flags and case statements are clunky,
  and subtrees with addpath require some care with paths

- bring the rest of Dave's code back as a calibration branch

- SDR mat file format?  probably can just fill out as needed

- test the hi-res code with Dave's ICT model without NLC--the NLC
  won't work but we can still try the ICT model

- "opts" is becoming mostly filenames and a few run parameters, 

- consider adding msc.err as a placeholder for returning errors in
  major procedures like calmain and rdr2sdr.  Possibly also add an
  opts.verbose flag, if used with restraint.

- do_allgeo needs to be a function

25 Apr 2012

- bring Dave's "science core" from dcast into the current calmain2.
  this is a 3-way merge of calmain3 initial parts, the old current
  calmain2 here, and calmain2 from dcast.

- current calmain2 -- prototype for dcast version; this has the
  sweep direction fix and my initial setup for calls to ICTradModel,
  nlc, and nlc params load w/ sweep direction fix

- current calmain3 -- history is calmain1 -> calmainX -> calmain3;
  has my spectral cal but needs needs emiss and nonlinearity code

- test out the file-spanning moving averages with the new code.  
  I haven't looked at this for a while

- integrate the geo struct from do_allgeo.m.  probably want to call
  this from the wrapper.  Can't simply pass in a list of rid string
  since this uses the IDPS SDR naming scheme.  Could simply process
  a day at a time.

- add Dave's non-linearity correction and ICT radiance modeling to
  the calmain3 branch

- add some documentation
