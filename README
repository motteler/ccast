Overview
---------
  ccast is software to take level zero data from the Cross-track
  Infrared Sounder (CrIS), a Fourier transform spectrometer on the
  Suomi NPP and JPSS weather satellites, and produce high-quality
  calibrated radiances.  It is written primarily in Matlab, allowing
  for easy interaction, modification, and data visualization.  Input
  is a CCSDS packet stream, typically with an HDF5 wrapper, and the
  output is Matlab-format HDF5 SDR files.

Features
---------
  Transparent reference truth.  The UMBC calibration algorithm uses
  "flat" reference truth, with a simple sinc basis at the user-grid
  OPD.  This gives residuals similar to the NOAA and UW algorithms
  using reference truth convolved with instrument responsivity.  But
  changing the definition of reference truth in this way amounts to
  adjusting the ruler to fit the measured quantity.
  
  Processing at the full sensor-grid decimated OPD, the "extended
  resolution" point set.  Points between the user- and sensor-grid
  OPD are given a cosine apodization.  This in contrast with the UW
  and NOAA algorithms, which approximate a circular shift followed
  by truncation.

  Spectral interpolation to the low (aka "standard") res user grid
  vs truncating interferograms to the original low-res sensor grid
  spec.  Interpolation is better for quality and consistency with
  high res, while truncation may be slightly better for consistency
  with obs before the switch to high res mode.

  Cleaner and simpler resampling, from noticing that several of 
  the proposed resampling algorithms converged as n -> inf and were
  being evaluated at "large n" (the undecimated point set), a value
  large enough that the differences were not significant.

  Simplicity and speed.  The package consists of less that 10,000
  lines of code, with about 5,000 lines of that from the main source
  directory.  Translation from RDR to L1a and from L1a to L1b/SDR
  each take about 1 second/scan on a single core.
