Some of the main procedures 
-----------------------------

rdr2mat     - process RDR h5 files to mat files

rdr2sdr     - process RDR mat files to SDR mat files
scipack     - process sci and eng packets
checkRDRf   - validate the RDR data
scanorder   - group data into scans
calmain2    - main calibration procedure, Dave T. version
calmain3    - main calibration procedure, new hi res branch

igm2spec    - take interferograms to uncalibrated spectra
inst_params - set selected instrument parameters
movavg_pre  - preprocess moving averages
movavg_app  - calculate or load moving averages

oaffov2     - spectral space SRF, Scott & Dave
mkSRFwl     - build SRF matrix tables for interpolation
getSRFwl    - wlaser SRF matrix interpolation
finterp     - fourier interpolation for FTIR data
bandpass    - spectral domain bandpass filter

sdr2rtp     - process SDR mat files to RTP files

davet/  - Dave's procedures (mostly from dcast) go here temporarily,
          as needed, after they are checked out to be compatible with 
          current version of the code.  mostly called by calmain2

davet2/ - Earlier versions of Dave's code, before the 20 Dec fork.


To Do List
-----------

bring Dave's "science core" from dcast into the current calmain2.
the main task remaining is to update the old calmain2 interface

test out the file-spanning moving averages with the new code.
I haven't looked at this for a while

integrate the geo struct from do_allgeo.m.  probably want to call
this from the wrapper.  Can't simply pass in a list of rid string
since this uses the IDPS SDR naming scheme.  Could simply process a
day at a time.

add Dave's non-linearity correction and ICT radiance modeling to
the calmain3 branch

add some documentation
