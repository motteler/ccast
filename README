bcast v 0.8, beta release  
--------------------------

H. Motteler, 6 April 2013

Overview
---------

This is a "beta" release.  The key procedures rdr2mat, geo_daily,
and rdr2sdr, which together take HDF RDR to Matlab SDR data, have
been tested extensively, but the wrappers and user environment are
still evolving.  

The to-do list includes documentation for the matfile SDR fields,
a high res version of the NLC correction, file-spanning moving
averages, and updating names from bcast to ccast.  There needs to
be better over-all documentation.  There is this README and often
detailed comments in individual procedures, but not much else.

There are some high-level design issues that could be addressed,
like what RDR reader to use, low-level data flow, output formats,
and so on, but these are probably not urgent.  The current output
is SDR mat files, which we translate to RTP or work with directly.
I'd originally intended this purely as an intermediate format but
they are compact and convenient for many applications.

Top level directories
----------------------

  docs      - documentation
  source    - main source directory
  motmsc    - my development and utils
  hires     - high res code and params
  davet     - Dave's code
  strow     - Larrabee's code
  readers   - MIT readers with local mods
  inst_data - instrument data:  nonlinearity, emissivity, etc.
  demo      - end-to-end demo with a small dataset

Matlab and data paths 
----------------------

I'd like to allow for a limited set of different versions of some
procedures by careful management of the matlab path.  This lets us
have things like a highres/inst_params.m and a source/inst_params.m,
or a source/calmain.m and a davet/calmain.m.  Mostly this just means
if you're working in your own directory you can, as an option, run
your own version of some of the code.  But you have to be careful
with this.

The search order for matlab procedures is the current directory and
then the reverse order they are set with addpath.  So for example if
you do

     addpath ../davet
     addpath ../source

and then run in motmsc, files there will take precence, then files
from source, and finally files from davet.

matlab paths here are relative, they assume you are running one
level below the bcast installation home.  Paths to data are set up
as ../yyyy/doy/ but that's just a convention, doy can be any subset
of the day's data.  The only restriction is that the current setup
uses doy to match the geo daily summary, so doy can't be a subset
that spans days.

Main processing steps
----------------------

  rdr2mat    - wrapper and some QC for the MIT reader
  geo_daily  - save a day of GCRSO data in a mat file
  avg_daily  - optional moving average preprocessing
  rdr2sdr    - main function for RDR to SDR processing

currently rdr2mat and geo_daily are called once a day after the
RDR HDF data has been downloaded, as a separate processing step.
bcast_main is a wrapper for rdr2sd4 that sets paths, files, and
options.

The use of the geo summary file is probably temporary, the
geo_match procedure could be modified to read the GCRSO files
directly.  But it only takes a couple of minutes to build the
summary file for a day's worth of data.

The moving average preprocessing (to allow moving averages to span
the 60-scan RDR files) has been tested with earlier versions of the
code but is not yet integrated with the current release.
