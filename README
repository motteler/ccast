H. Motteler, 14 Aug 2014

Overview
---------

CCAST is software to take level zero data from the Cross-track
Infrared Sounder (CrIS), a Fourier transform spectrometer on the
Suomi NPP and JPSS weather satellites, and produce high-quality
calibrated radiances.  It is written primarily in Matlab, allowing
for easy interaction, modification, and data visualization.  Input
is a CCSDS packet stream, typically with an HDF5 wrapper, and the
output is Matlab-format HDF5.
