bcast v 0.8, beta release  
--------------------------

H. Motteler, 6 April 2013

 


Overview
---------

This is an "alpha" release.  The key procedures rdr2mat, geo_daily,
and rdr2sdr, which together take HDF RDR to Matlab SDR data, have
been tested extensively, but the wrappers and user environment are
still evolving.  

Major steps remaining include: integrate the old file-spanning
moving average code, integrate Dave's radiometric calibration code
from the old ccast, and write routines to translate the Matlab SDR
data to more useful formats.


Top level directories
----------------------

  docs    - documentation
  source  - main source directory
  motmsc  - my dev, utils, and junk
  hires   - high res code and params
  davet   - Dave's code
  strow   - Larrabee's code
  readers - MIT readers with local mods
  inst_data - instrument data: ILS, nonlinearity, emissivity, etc.
  demo    - end-to-end demo with a small dataset


Matlab and data paths 
----------------------

I'd like to allow for a limited set of different versions of some
procedures by careful management of matlab path.  This lets us have
things like a highres/inst_params.m and a source/inst_params.m, or 
a source/calmain.m and a davet/calmain.m.  Mostly this just means if
you're working in your own directory you can, as an option, run your
own version of some of the code.  But you have to be careful with
this.

The search order for matlab procedures is the current directory and
then the reverse order they are set with addpath.  So for example if
you do

     addpath ../davet
     addpath ../source

and then run in motmsc, files there will take precence, then files
from source, and finally files from davet.

matlab paths here are relative, they assume you are running one
level below the bcast installation home.  Paths to data are set up
as ../yyyy/doy/ but that's just a convention, doy can be any subset
of the day's data.  The only restriction is that the current setup
uses doy to match the geo daily summary, so doy can't be a subset
that spans days.


Main processing steps
----------------------

  rdr2mat    - wrapper and some QC for the MIT reader
  geo_daily  - save a day of GCRSO data in a mat file
  avg_daily  - optional moving average preprocessing
  rdr2sdr    - main function for RDR to SDR processing

currently rdr2mat and geo_daily are called once a day after the
RDR HDF data has been downloaded, as a separate processing step.
bcast_main is a wrapper for rdr2sd4 that sets paths, files, and
options.

The use of the geo summary file is probably temporary, the
geo_match procedure could be modified to read the GCRSO files
directly.  But it only takes a couple of minutes to build the
summary file for a day's worth of data.

The moving average preprocessing (to allow moving averages to span
the 60-scan RDR files) has been tested with earlier versions of the
code but is not yet integrated with the current release.

The following are mostly vaporware

  sdr2rtp    - save SDRs as RTP files
  sdr2netcdf - save SDRs as netcdf files
  sdr2map    - tile SDRs for fancy maps, data QC, etc.
