Note that $dx$ is the same for both pairs of equations.  For axis
(2) to be a common intermediate step we want $dx$ to divide $L_1$
and $L_2$ with no remainder, that is, for some integers $m$ and $n$,
$m \cdot dx = L_1$ and $n \cdot dx = L_2$, or $dx = L_1/m$ and $dx =
L_2/n$. \\
\medskip
Equating expressions for $dx$ we have $L_1 / m = L_2 / n$, and so
\begin{eqnarray*}
  m / n & = & L_1 / L_2 \\
        & = & (1/ 2\/dv_1) / (1/ 2\/dv_2) \\
        & = & dv_2 / dv_1
\end{eqnarray*}

To fill in the remaining parameters we need to express $dv_2 / dv_1$
as a ratio of integers, that is, as a rational number.
