The AIRS and CrIS latbin functions tabulate lat, lon, time, and
zenith angles for all obs over a set of days and selected scan
pattern.  They take a latitude weighted subset and plot stats both
as histograms and as area weighted maps.  airs_latbin reads the lat
and lon fields from the airs granules, while cris_latbin reads the
ccast allgeo files

  airs_latbin - lat and lon bins for AIRS obs
  cris_latbin - lat and lon bins for CrIS obs

  plot_latbin - equal area obs counts and diffs
  plot_zenbin - equal area secant means and diffs
  plot_mscbin - equal area longitude means and difs
  plot_taibin - equal area time means and diffs

The AIRS and CrIS tbin functions take a list of days, cross track
indices, and frequencies, and build a table of obs per temperature
bin.  Relatively slow because they read all granules over the time
span.  plot_tbin plots comparison results and has a list of recent
tests in the comments.

  airs_tbin  - AIRS Tb bins with optional lat and ocean subsetting
  cris_tbin  - CrIS Tb bins with optional lat and ocean subsetting
  plot_tbin  - comparison plots for airs_tbin and cris_tbin
  plot_tbin? - variations on the basic plot_tbin tests

functions

  equal_area_bins - count and mean for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_spherical_bands - equal area latitude bands
  usgs_deg10_dem - calculate land fraction
