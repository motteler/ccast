The AIRS and CrIS latbin functions tabulate lat and lon values for
all obs over a set of days and selected scan pattern.  They take a
latitude weighted subset and plot stats both as histograms and as
area weighted maps.  airs_latbin reads the lat and lon fields from
the airs granules, while cris_latbin reads the ccast allgeo files

  airs_latbin - lat and lon bins for AIRS obs
  cris_latbin - lat and lon bins for CrIS obs

The AIRS and CrIS tbin functions take a list of days, cross track
indices, and frequencies, and build a table of obs per temperature
bin.  Relatively slow because they read all granules over the time
span.  plot_tbin plots comparison results and has a list of recent
tests in the comments.

  airs_tbin   - temperature bins for AIRS L1c obs
  airs_tbin2  - AIRS Tb bins with latitude subsetting
  airs_tbin3  - AIRS Tb bins with lat and ocean subsetting

  cris_tbin   - temperature bins for CrIS ccast obs
  cris_tbin2  - CrIS Tb bins with latitude subsetting
  cris_tbin3  - CrIS Tb bins with lat and ocean subsetting

  plot_tbin   - plot results from airs_tbin and cris_tbin

functions

  equal_area_trap - count and mean for equal area trapezoids
  equal_area_spherical_bands - equal area latitude bands
  usgs_deg10_dem - calculate land fraction
