Design choices for output format and features such as file-spanning
moving averages depend on the RDR reader and its integration with the
validation code in checkRDRf.  It was convenient for development but
we should probably move away from a one-to-one correspondence between
RDR and SDR files, and present the SDR data in a more regularized way.
The current geo preprocessing step is needed mainly because the GCRSO
geo and RDR files don't match up.

Despite these problems the calibration code--both the UMBC and davet
branches--works well and for the most part is in close agreement with
the IDPS and ADL codes.  Differences that remain are more likely due
to different physical assumptions and modeling than any problems that
are purely with the code.

The use of the geo summary file may be temporary, the geo_match
procedure could be modified to read the GCRSO files directly.  But
it only takes a couple of minutes to build the summary file for a
day's worth of data.

The moving average preprocessing, to allow moving averages to span
the 60-scan RDR files, has been tested with earlier versions of the
code but is not yet integrated with the current release.  This may
wait on a more general rewrite of the lower layers of the code.
