MITreader380a -- the MIT v380 reader modified (and significantly
simplified) to work with Dan's new general-purpose interferogram
upacking function bit_unpack_all.c and to read bit trim values from
either eng packets or a cached value until the first eng packet is
found.  I added read_cris_ccsds.m to read CCSDS format test data,
and tested these against both MITreader380 and an early version of
the MIT reader from around 2007.

main top-level procedures
  read_cris_hdf5_rdr  - read a CrIS RDR file
  read_cris_ccsds     - read a CrIS CCSDS packet file

read_cris_ccsds is just a stripped down version of the RDR reader,
and a expects a single file.  So (at least for now) if you want to
run on a set of CCSDS files they should be concatenated first.

For regular ccast processing, the procedure source/checkRDR.m puts
interferogram data from the MIT reader in time order.  obs times are
sorted, merged, and duplicates are dropped, and some sanity checks
are done on the resulting timeline.
