The output scripts write data to either low (sdr60) or high
(sdr60_hr) res directories.  The driver scripts read RDR mat files
that are partitioned into separate groups for low res, high res 2,
and high res 3.  So running the script outside the defined range
does not hurt anything, it will will simply produce no output.

reprocessing for both low and high res should be organized by
res shifts, since each res mode uses a different driver script.
sbatch_array.m must be edited for the desired production script
typically ccast_lowres, hires2, hires3, h2tolow, or h3tolow

currently running

  sbatch --array=1-365%20 ccast_array.sh 2013

typical production batch command, span with jobs limit

  sbatch --array=306-365%20 ccast_array.sh 2015

typical cleanup batch command, do 3 selected days

  sbatch --array=349,354,361 ccast_array.sh 2015

done:
  all high res 2014-2017
  low res 2014 h2tolow, 2015, 2017
