currently doing 2015 low res cleanup

  sbatch --array=349,354,361 ccast_array.sh 2015

   most low res 2015, cleaning up now

sample search for old files

  find /asl/data/cris/ccast/sdr60/2015 -depth -type f -mtime +70 -print | more

typical cleanup batch command, do 3 selected days

  sbatch --array=349,354,361 ccast_array.sh 2015

typical production batch command, span with jobs limit

  sbatch --array=306-365%20 ccast_array.sh 2015

note sbatch_array.m must be edited for the desired production script
typically ccast_lowres, hires2, hires3, h2tolow, or h3tolow

format changes
  4 Dec 2014 (doy xxx) change from lowres to hires2
  2 Nov 2015 (doy xxx) change from hires2 to hires3
  
The output scripts merge data to low (sdr60) and high (sdr60_hr) res
directories

The driver scripts read RDR mat files that are partitioned into
separate groups for low res, high res 2, and high res 3.  So running
the script outside the defined range does not hurt anything, it will
will simply produce no output.
