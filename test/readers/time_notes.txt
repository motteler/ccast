% TIME UNITS
%   the ccsds packet times are represented as day, ms of day, and us
%   of ms.  The us field may not be significant.  Dan's reader takes
%   this to UTC fractional days since 1958.  checkRDR returns time as
%   UTC ms since 1958.  This was convenient for working with internal
%   times but isn't used anywhere else on the planet
%
%   geo.FORTime, geoTime, and scTime are all IET time.  sci.time is
%   still UTC ms since 1958.  eng time fields may be in the original
%   ccsds time format
%
%   This all needs to be cleaned up by switching to one time format,
%   probably IET.  But for now the mix gives compatibility with the
%   old ccast
